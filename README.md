**Title:** Exploring the nexus between financial strain, wellbeing, and life satisfaction among Bangladeshi university students during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021: A cross-sectional study

**Abstract**

**Background:** 

Financial stress among university students is pervasive and profoundly affects their mental wellbeing. This study aims to examine the wellbeing and life satisfaction of university students during the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of their financial circumstances.

**Materials and Methods:** 

A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in 2021 on 1125 university students in a secondary city of Bangladesh using a structured questionnaire covering sociodemographic characteristics, financial circumstances, the World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5), and the Satisfaction with Life Scale. Descriptive analysis, Chi-square tests, canonical correlation analysis, t-tests, analysis of variance, and Duncan tests were employed to analyze the data.

**Results:** 

The survey revealed that the majority of students were aged 18â€“23, predominantly male, and came from educated families. Financial strain was evident, with nearly half relying solely on family support and a significant portion contributing jointly with family. Significant financial instability was found, with many students experiencing job loss and income reduction, leading to moderate life satisfaction and lower levels of wellbeing. Students relying on scholarships reported the highest wellbeing and life satisfaction, while those with less than 1 month of savings exhibited the lowest scores.

**Conclusion:**

The study highlights the urgent need for holistic interventions to support university students in Bangladesh facing mental health and financial stress due to COVID-19. Health policymakers and nursing managers should establish comprehensive mental health support systems, including counseling and financial literacy programs, while collaborating with local organizations for emergency financial assistance to foster a healthier student population.
